# GameOfLife is my rendition of Conway's Game of Life

## **Code**

The source code is Java. In addition to the game itself I tried to create a properties object. I am not sure it is quite done yet. Presently it makes things look a bit clunky. 

## **Suggestions**

This code is intended as an exercise for me to apply my learning of Java. I am quite open to suggestions and
recommendations for improvement.

## **License**

If you wish to use any of this code for personal and/or educational purposes you may freely do so as long as you do not
claim it as your own. Give a guy a little credit if you use his work.

If you wish to make money with this code, such as publishing it in a tutorial or making a salable product I want a cut
of the action. As unlikely as this may be, simply contact me, so we can work out the details.
